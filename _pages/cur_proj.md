## Global snow crab dynamics under climate change

Snow crab are an ecologically and economically important species in higher latitudes in the northern hemisphere. In total, seven countries harvest ~200,000 tonnes each year. Snow crab are associated with cold bottom waters and recently the Bering Sea population collapsed after a marine heatwave. The goals of this project are:

 - Collaborate with international snow crab scientists to put all available data into a common population dynamics framework
 - Identify relationships between estimates of recruitment, mortality, and maturity with environmental and demographic covariates
 - Identify conditions under which collapse is likely
 - Generalize lessons learned from snow crab management for other resources under climate stress

## Mortality events in eastern Bering Sea crab 

Crab are some of the most abundant species in the Bering Se and support fisheries historically values at over $300 million ex-vessel per year. Boom and bust dynamics are common and have resulted in fisheries closures for several stocks. In this project we:

 - Model variability in mortality for six species of crab in the Bering Sea using size-structured population dynamics models
 - Explain that variability using GAMs with density, ice extent, size, and temperature as covariates
 - Develop 'ecological histories' to describe the observed dynamics for both heavily and lightly fished species
 - Identify disconnects between current management paradigms, the observed dynamics, and stated goals of management
