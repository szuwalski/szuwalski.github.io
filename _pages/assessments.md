## Eastern Bering Sea snow crab (2016-present)

The EBS snow crab assessment is performed annually to provide management advice to the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council.

## Pribilof Islands red king crab (2014-present)

There is currently no fishery for red king crab around the Pribilof Islands, so the assessment is done less frequently.

## Alaskan forage fish (2021-present)

One of the hallmarks of Alaskan management is the absence of directed fishing on forage fish. In spite of a lack of fishing, assessments are periodically performed. Shrimp (below) are one of many 'forage' species monitored.
