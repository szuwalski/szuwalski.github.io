Abstract: Snow crab are an iconic species in the Bering Sea that support an economically important fishery and undergo extensive monitoring and management. Since 2018 more than 10 billion snow crab have disappeared from the eastern Bering Sea and the population collapsed to historical lows in 2021. We link this collapse to a marine heatwave in the eastern Bering Sea during 2018 and 2019. Calculated caloric requirements, reduced spatial distribution, and observed body condition suggest that starvation played a role in the collapse. The mortality event appears to be one of the largest reported losses of motile marine macrofauna to marine heatwaves globally.
